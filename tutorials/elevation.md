# Elevation

All components already have a default elevation.

You can set a different elevation to an element using the `elevation-X` class, where `X` is a number that start from `0` to `24`.

```html
<button class="elevation-12">
  Very elevated button
</button>
```

A button usually have an elevation of `2`, using the class `elevation-12` will now have an elevation of `12`

#### Erase elevation
You can use the class `elevation-0` to remove the elevation of an element
