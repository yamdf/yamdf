# YAMDF
### The first Stylus Material Design framework


Welcome to YAMDF: Yet Another Material Design Framework
> Please note that YAMDF is in very alpha stage, just few components are developed and completed.

### Developed or partially developed components:
- Basic Appbar
- Buttons (Raised, Outlined, Flat, with icons)
- FAB Buttons (Normal, Mini, Extended)
- Data Tables (Flat, Raised, with Header)
- Menus (still not totally developed)
- Selection Control components (Checkboxes and Switches)
- Text Fields (Normal)
- Elevation

### How to use YAMDF
- Download the CSS and JS files
- Create a simple `index.html` file where YAMDF files and Roboto and Material Icons CSS files are linked (you can find an example below)
- Start creating the components

### How to create components
You can find some tutorials for every component in the [tutorials folder](https://github.com/yamdf/yamdf/tree/master/tutorials)

### Starter `index.html` file

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto"
          rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
          rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="main.css"
          rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    
    <!--
    
      Your components here
    
    -->
    
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
